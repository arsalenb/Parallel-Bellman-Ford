# 588II - Computer Architecture
This project analyzes and benchmarks several parallel implementations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, focusing on performance trade-offs across different parallelization strategies. The solution was implemented in C, leveraging Pthreads for multi-core CPU parallelism and CUDA for GPU acceleration. 

This work was completed as the final project for the Computer Architecture course.
